      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Have you ever tried to or wan to assemble build your own computer?
        Having a computer that can handle the tasks that you require of it has
        become an essential part of todays high speed world. Being able to
        control exactly what goes into your own personal computer can be very
        beneficial. However, not all PC parts are compatible with each other.
        Our goal at Performance PC is to take the guess work out of building a
        PC. We vet each and when you decide on a part to add to your computer,
        we will only show you other parts that are compatible. Once you have
        selected the parts you desire, you can have them all shipped to you for
        your building pleasure or you can have us assemble it for you
        professionally. Whether for business or fun you can count on our
        expertise to help pick the parts that are right for you.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        We aim to serve the PC enthusiast. Whether you are a gamer or a
        professional video or photo editor, our goal is to build you the PC you
        need. Using our simple questionnaire, we ask you what your desired focus
        is and we will give you our expert recommendation. But feel free to
        modify your PC to your liking. Once you have finished selecting your
        parts you can have us assemble it or we can send the parts to you to

        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: [Passion One]
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        [Reasoning] A good strong, bold font is good for headings. This one
        still keeps up a professional appearance and grabs the readers
        attention.

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: [Roboto]
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        [Reasoning] I chose Roboto (sans-serif) for my font paragraphs as it is
        a simple font. I dont want to distract and overwhelm the customer and it
        has the appearance of professionalism

        This website will be used to help people build a computer with the
        necessary parts that they require. There are many different parts that
        can be put into a compueter and not all of them are compatible with each
        other. Our goel is to automatically check for compatiblity after
        different parts are selected.

        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this
        information or complete the actions?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Our site will have an easy to use interface and we will help direct the
        customer to get the parts they need. Other websites assume that the user
        knows beforehand what they want but we intend to help the user fill in
        any gaps in their PC build that they might have. We will also insure
        that the parts are compatible. Finally, we will offer them the option to
        build the PC themselves or have us build it for them. If they decide to
        build it all parts will be shipped together and will arrive ready for
        assembly with a basic instruction manual/guide.

        necessary for the customer. For example someone who answers with "They
        want to use this computer for high end graphic design and video editing"
        will get a different parts recommendation than someone who answers with
        "Casual/Budget gaming and media consumption"
